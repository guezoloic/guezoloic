# Hello there 👋

I am **GUEZO Loïc**, a French student passionate about IT and electronics.

## 📣 About Me 
This Github profile contains my personal projects and challenges. I'm particulary interested in **low-level programming** and have already enjoyed exploring how computers work at a fundamental 
level.

I love working on projects involving **embedded systems**, **retro computing**, and **electronics**. From programming in **assembly** with *NASM*, experimenting with the **6502 processor** (from [**Ben Eater's kit**](https://eater.net)), to working with the [**Jetson Nano**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/) from *NVIDIA* for AI computing. I enjoy diving deep into both hardware and software. 

I also enjoy working on various projects and constantly learning new technologies, whether it's **hacking, front-end/back-end dev, machine learning, and other fields**.
