            "Curious by nature, I love exploring what really happens under the hood of a computer.",
            "I started with simple Python programs and gradually discovered my fascination for low-level computing.",
            "Learning Intel x86 assembly at School and working with retro-computing kits, I realized I truly enjoy building things from scratch and understanding them at the most fundamental level.",
            "Over time, I specialized in low-level programming (C, C++, Rust, SIMD) and embedded systems (STM32, Jetson, Raspberry Pi, ATtiny85).",
            "I enjoy creating efficient solutions, from custom math libraries with SSE/NEON to fine-tuning device trees for hardware integration.",
            "Recently, I have combined this expertise with modern innovation by deploying AI and computer vision models on embedded devices and experimenting with edge computing.",
            "Beyond embedded engineering, I also work on servers, AI projects, and game engines, balancing hardware and software to make each project both challenging and rewarding."
